Lately I have been feeling a little unmotivated in terms of my self-learning ability, work, college, chores and laziness have made me underestimate my ability to learn.

I really am learning, even if it is at a slow pace.

That is why I decided to start this series of posts of no more 0 days. The concept behind that term simply indicates that there can be no 0% days.

So from now on I will post the learning time spent and the learnings of the day.

Additionally I will be able to add a section of ideas or things to review.

### Time spent
- 1 hour

### Work
- Worked on my blogs in Astro.
- Started the blogs monorepo.

### Apprenticeships
- C++
    - The different ways to create strings: cin.getline, fgets, char[]...
    - Sizeof function to get the size of a string.
    - '\0' null character to stop the difinition of an string declared as char array.

### To review / make
- Redo the multiplication matrices exercise again. First in pseudo-code and then in C++.
- Develop some of the proposed Chatgpt exercises to practise three nesting levels of loops for matrix operations.
